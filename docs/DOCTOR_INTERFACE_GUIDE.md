# Doctor Interface Guide

This document outlines doctor-specific flows and UI components.

- Doctor dashboard lists assigned patients, allows uploading reports, managing emergency contacts, triggering SOS, and sharing hospital location.
- RBAC: only users with role `doctor` should access these pages and APIs.

(Placeholder — add wireframes and API mappings.)
